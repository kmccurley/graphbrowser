# Graph Browser

This contains code and data for browsing collaboration graphs (a kind of social network
graph). The code is broken into pieces:

1. data preparatation code under data/
2. app code is under public/, including code that runs on the server, but also
   client side code served through index.php. That subdirectory can be copied to
   a directory on a php-equipped web server. Configuration is stored in db.php.

In addition, data/ contains the original data for two databases, namely DBLP and cryptodb.
